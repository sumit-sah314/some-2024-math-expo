Title: This Classic Physics Problem's Beautiful Connection to Euler‚Äôs Formula Totally Blew Me Away

**INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM**
You might have come across this problem in physics or math class while studying vectors. Imagine you have ùëõ vectors of the same length, all pointing out from a central point and evenly spaced around a circle, each making an angle of 2ùúã/ùëõ radians. These vectors balance each other out perfectly, so their sum is zero.

I know throwing this type of mathematical definition of a problem doesnt seem intuitive at first. Therefore, I always find it helpful to start with some specific examples. Lets start with how and when did i first time i encountered this problem. 

Picture a ring with a uniform positive charge. What‚Äôs the electric field intensity at its center?

Think of this ring being made up of many infinitesimal charge elements dQ. Each element creates a small electric field dE which is directed radially outward along the line connecting dQ and center. All these electric fields are of equal magnitude because of being at the same distance, evenly spaced around in a circle. The vector sum of all these electric fields is 0.

When I asked my teacher why, he just said, "It's symmetry." Each charge element has an equal charge directly opposite it, so they cancel out. This makes sense for continuous distributions, but what about discrete charges? With an even number, each field has an opposite to cancel it out. With an odd number, there‚Äôs no exact opposite field to cancel out.

If you're still not following, here's another example:

Imagine a block on a frictionless surface being pulled by a force in one direction. According to Newton‚Äôs law, the block accelerates in that direction. But if you apply an equal force in the opposite direction, the forces cancel out and the block stays still. Notice our formula holds true‚Äîtwo forces making an angle of ùúã.

Now, let‚Äôs take it a step further. What if we have three forces, each separated by 2ùúã/3 radians (120 degrees)? Adding these vectors can be tricky, but we use the parallelogram law of vector addition: If you consider two vectors at a point as adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the resultant is given by the diagonal.You see, the result is equal and opposite to the third force.

Similarly, with four forces making an angle of ùúã/2 (90 degrees), they cancel each other out because each force has an opposite to cancel it.

This rule works for any number of forces‚Äî5, 6, or 7‚Äîas long as there's more than one. If there's only one force, there's nothing to balance it out. So it does not apply.

How do we prove if it works for all n?

One way to think about it is by shifting each vector without changing their angle, connecting the tail of one to the head of another. They form a closed polygon, making the resultant zero. This works well for special cases, but what about a more general proof without geometry?

The main goal of me making this video isn't just give you intuition to this class problem often encountered in physics and math. When you dive deeper start questioning why this works for any number of vectors, you‚Äôll find that Euler's formula, one of the most beautiful theorems in math, offers elegent proof that you might not often find in textbooks or online. It might be surprising that abstract concept like Euler‚Äôs Formula can help prove this practical physics problem, but trust me, this video will be interesting because you‚Äôll see one of the most beautiful proofs in physics and mathematics.

**STARTING PROOF**
Let‚Äôs begin by considering these vectors acting at the origin of an x-y plane. Our goal is to find the sum of all these vectors. When dealing with multiple coplanar vectors, it‚Äôs always helpful to resolve them into their x and y components.

So, what does it mean to resolve a vector? It involves expressing any vector as the sum of two perpendicular components: one along the x-axis and one along the y-axis. In other words, we project the vectors onto the x and y axes.

For a vector with magnitude ‚à£ùë£‚à£ and making an angle Œ∏ with the x-axis:
The x-component of the vector is: ‚à£v‚à£‚ãÖcos(Œ∏).
The y-component of the vector is: ‚à£v‚à£‚ãÖsin(Œ∏).

We do this for each of the vectors. This approach is really helpful because by decomposing all vectors into their x and y components, we simplify the math. We can then independently add the x-components and y-components of all vectors.

Let's apply this to our problem. For simplicity, we'll assume that each vector has a magnitude of 1. Later, I'll show that if this works for unit vectors, it will also work for vectors of any magnitude

We'll number the vectors from 0 to n-1. Each vector is evenly spaced around the circle, so the angle between consecutive vectors is $$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$. To find the x and y components of each vector, we need to determine the angle each vector makes with the x-axis.

  -The 0th vector is along the x-axis, so it makes an angle of \(0\) radians with the x-axis.
  -The 1st vector makes an angle of \(\frac{2\pi}{n}\) radians with the x-axis.
  -The 2nd vector makes an angle of \(\frac{4\pi}{n}\) radians with the x-axis.
  -The 3rd vector makes an angle of \(\frac{6\pi}{n}\) radians with the x-axis.

Following this pattern, the k-th vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2k\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.

For each vector \(k\), the x and y components can be calculated using:
\begin{align*}
    \text{x-component} &= \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \\
    \text{y-component} &= \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Sum of x-Components}

To find the total x-component of all vectors, sum up the x-components of each vector:

\[
\text{Total x-component} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)
\]

\subsection*{Sum of y-Components}

Similarly, the total y-component is:

\[
\text{Total y-component} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)
\]

For those who don't know what Euler‚Äôs formula is, I would recommend watching my 
previous video in this playlist. For now, I am going to give a brief intro to 
what it is. You can picture a point in a unit circle in a complex plane, and 
represent it as a vector making angle with the x-axis. This vector can be 
expressed in the exponential form as, which equals.

Now, let's imagine there are vectors around this circle. We can represent each 
of these vectors in exponential form and sum them all to find the result. So, to 
represent it in exponential form we need to know what angles each of these 
vectors make with the x-axis. Let's number these vectors from to. The th vector 
makes angle, the st makes, the nd makes, and so on. The, and so on. The th 
vector makes an angle. 

So, the th vector is. Summing both sides, we get:

Summing those trigonometric functions can be tedious. So, we express them in 
exponential form using Euler‚Äôs formula. It becomes:

If we expand the summation, we get:

This is a geometric series. To sum a geometric series, we use the formula for 
the sum of a geometric series. Notice that is common in all terms. Let's assume 
for simplicity. Our series now simplifies to:

The sum of this geometric series is given by:

Since, replacing x in the formula, we get. We know that:

which equals 1. Therefore, the sum reduces to:

Hence, the total sum is 0. See how easy that was.

Now let's talk about why this idea matters in the real world. Fans and Turbines: 
The blades of fans and turbines are often placed 120 degrees apart. This design 
ensures that the forces on the central axis are balanced, resulting in smooth 
and efficient rotation.

Electric Motors: In three-phase electric motors, the currents are phase-shifted 
by 120 degrees to ensure the motor runs smoothly and efficiently by balancing 
the forces within the motor.

Triangular Trusses in Bridges: The forces in a triangular truss bridge are 
evenly distributed and balanced, which provides stability and strength to the 
structure. This design helps in constructing stable and strong bridges that can 
bear heavy loads without bending or collapsing.
