Title: This Classic Physics Problem's Beautiful Connection to Euler‚Äôs Formula Totally Blew Me Away

**INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM**

Hey there!Welcome to Math Simplified!

Let‚Äôs dive into this classic problem that you‚Äôve probably seen in your physics or math class, especially when dealing with vectors. Picture this: you have ùëõ vectors, all of the same length, spreading out from a central point and evenly spaced around a circle. Each one makes an angle of $$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$ radians with the next. The big question is: what‚Äôs the resultant sum of all these vectors?

You might already know that because of their symmetrical arrangement, these vectors perfectly cancel each other out, resulting in a sum of zero. But just saying "symmetry" doesn't really give us a full explanation of why the sum is zero. Let‚Äôs break it down and see what‚Äôs really going on here.

One way to get a better grasp of this is by picturing the vectors being shifted, without changing their angles, so that the tail of one connects to the head of another. When you do this, they form a closed polygon, which is why the resultant sum is zero. It‚Äôs a cool way to visualize the concept. But the goal of this video isn‚Äôt just to give you a feel for the problem. If you dig a little deeper and start asking why this works for any number of vectors, you‚Äôll discover that Euler‚Äôs formula‚Äîone of the most beautiful theorems in mathematics‚Äîoffers an elegant proof that you might not see in your textbooks.

It might seem surprising that such an abstract concept like Euler‚Äôs Formula can prove something so practical in physics, but trust me, this video is going to be exciting. We‚Äôre about to explore one of the most beautiful connections between math and physics.

To make this concept more concrete, let's look at a specific example. I know the mathematical definition might seem a bit abstract, so I'll start with how I first encountered this problem in my physics class.

Picture a ring with a uniform positive charge. What‚Äôs the electric field intensity at its center?

Think of this ring as being made up of many infinitesimal charge elements dQ. Each element creates a small electric field dE, which is directed radially outward along the line connecting dQ and the center of the ring. According to Coulomb's law, the magnitude of this electric field is given by:

                              $$|dE| = \frac{k_e \cdot |dQ|}{r^2}$$

where $$k_e$$ is Coulomb's constant, $$|dQ|$$ is the magnitude of the charge element, and $$r$$  is the distance from the charge to the point where the field is being calculated‚Äîin this case, the center of the ring.

The magnitude of the electric field depends on the amount of charge $$dQ$$ and the distance $$r$$ from the charge. Since we are considering a uniformly charged ring, each element $$dQ$$ has the same charge because the charge is evenly distributed along the entire ring. Additionally, because all these elements are equidistant from the center, being part of a circle, the electric fields they produce are of equal magnitude.

The vector sum of all these electric fields turns out to be zero.

When I asked my teacher why this happens, he simply said, "It's symmetry." Each charge element $$dQ$$ on the ring has an equal $$dQ$$ located directly opposite, canceling each other out. This symmetry explanation works well for continuous charge distributions. But what happens if we‚Äôre dealing with a discrete number of charges around the circle?

With an even number of charges, it‚Äôs easy to see that each electric field has an exact opposite to cancel it out. But what if there‚Äôs an odd number of charges? There‚Äôs no exact opposite field to cancel out each one. So, does this balancing act still hold for any number of vectors?

If you're still not quite getting the gist of the problem, no worries, let me give you another example:

Imagine a block on a frictionless surface being pulled in one direction. According to Newton's laws, the block accelerates in that direction. But if you apply an equal force in the opposite direction, the forces cancel out and the block stays still. Notice how our formula holds true‚Äî‚Äîtwo forces making an angle of $$\frac{2\pi}{2}$$, which is $$\pi$$ radians.

Now, let‚Äôs take it a step further. What if we have three forces, each separated by $$\frac{2\pi}{3}$$ radians? Adding these vectors can be a bit tricky, but we can use the parallelogram law of vector addition: if you think of two vectors at a point as adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the resultant is given by the diagonal. In this case, you‚Äôll see that the resultant is equal and opposite to the third force.

Similarly, with four forces making an angle of $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$, they cancel each other out because each force has an opposite to cancel it.

This rule works for any number of forces‚Äî5, 6, or 7‚Äîas long as there's more than one. If there's only one force, there's nothing to balance it out. So it does not apply.

Here's the revised version of our problem statement: If there are ùëõ equal vectors acting at a point and making an angle of 
$$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$, evenly spaced around a circle, such that $$n>1$$, then they should balance out to $$0$$.

So, how do we prove this works for any number of vectors ùëõ?

**STARTING PROOF**

Let‚Äôs start by considering these vectors at the origin of an x-y plane. To keep things simple, we'll assume that each vector has a magnitude of 1.

Let's assign numbers to these vectors from 0 to $$n-1$$. We'll assume, ùëò represents the index of each vector, ranging from 0 to n-1. For each vector ùëò, we can describe its components using unit vectors along the x-axis and y-axis.Here, the x-component represents the projection of the vector along the x-axis, scaled by the cosine of the angle it makes with the x-axis $$\theta_k$$. 
             
                $$\text{x-component} = \cos\left(\theta_k\right) \hat{i}$$

Similarly, the y-component represents the projection along the y-axis, scaled by the sine of the angle.

                $$\text{y-component} = \sin\left(\theta_k\right) \hat{j}$$

Decomposing a vector into these components is useful because it lets us sum the vectors by adding their x-components and y-components separately, simplifying the calculation of the resultant vector.

Here, the angle $$\theta_k$$ can be expressed as a function of the vector index $$k$$, for each vector. Since each vector is evenly spaced around a circle, the angle between consecutive vectors is $$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$:

        The 0th vector aligns with the x-axis, making an angle of $$0$$ radians.
        The 1st vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.
        The 2nd vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2\cdot2\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.
        The 3rd vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2\cdot3\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.

Following this pattern, the $$k_th$$ vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2k\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.

Substituting this expression for $$\theta_k$$ into our vector expression, we get:

              $$\vec{\text{v}}_k = \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{i} + \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{j}$$

The k-th vector, represented by $$v_k$$ can thus be written as the sum of these components:

              $$\vec{\text{v}}_k = \cos\left(\theta_k\right) \hat{i} + \sin\left(\theta_k\right) \hat{j}$$

Now, to find the total vector sum, we add up all the vectors from $$k = 0$$ to $$n - 1$$. The total vector sum is:

               $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \vec{\text{v}}_k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(\cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{i} + 
               \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{j}\right)$$

Breaking this down into x and y components, we have:

               $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{i} + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi} 
                {n}\right) \hat{j}$$

Thus, the sum of all the vectors is the sum of the x-components plus the sum of the y-components. This decomposition simplifies the process of finding the resultant vector.

To prove that the vector sum is zero, we need to show that both the sum of the x and y components sum to zero simultaneously. That is, we need to prove:

                 $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 
                    \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) = 0$$

This is a sub-problem within our original problem, and directly proving these sums are zero using trigonometric identities can be complex and tedious. Here, Euler's formula provides an elegant solution.

If you clicked on this video, you probably already have a basic understanding of Euler's Formula. I won‚Äôt dive deep into the details since I‚Äôve covered it in my earlier videos in this playlist. For now, let me give you a quick overview. Picture a point in a complex plane that is a unit distance away from the origin making an angle $$\theta$$ with the x-axis. It represent a complex number with real part $$\cos(\theta)$$ and imaginary part $$\sin(\theta)$$. According to Euler's Formula, this complex number can also be written in an exponential form:

                   $$e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$$

In this context, we are going to shift these vectors into the complex plane. Here each vector can be represented as a comlex number, where the real part $$\cos{2k\pi}{n}$$ corresponds to the x-component and the imaginary part $$\sin{2k\pi}{n}$$corresponds to the y-component. Thanks to Euler's Formula, these vectors can also be written in an exponential form:

                   $$e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)$$

So, the sum of all these vectors is:

                  $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) + 
                     i\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)$$

If we can somehow prove that the sum of these exponents is zero, i.e.,

                   $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = 0$$

then both its real and imaginary parts must also be zero. This would imply:

                  $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 
                     \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) = 0$$

The sum of x and y components of the vectors is zero, resulting in a null or zero vector.

Alright, let‚Äôs jump right into our final proof. Let‚Äôs take another look at this exponential representation of the vector sum.
            
                    $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}}

When we expand this summation, it looks like this:

                    $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = 1 + e^{i \frac{2\pi}{n}} + e^{i \frac{4\pi}{n}} + \ldots + 
                       e^{i \frac{2(n-1)\pi}{n}}$$

Notice that \( e^{i \frac{2\pi}{n}} \) is common in all terms, , so let‚Äôs make things simpler by setting $$e^{i \frac{2\pi}{n}} = x$$. Now, our series looks like this:

                         $$ 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \ldots + x^{n-1}$$

This should look familiar‚Äîit‚Äôs a geometric series! To sum up a geometric series, we use a specific formula. The sum of this geometric series is given by:

                          $$ \frac{1-x^n}{1-x} $$

Since we have \( x = e^{i \frac{2\pi}{n}} \), replacing \( x \) in the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - e^{i\frac{2\pi}{n} \cdot n}}{1 - e^{i\frac{2\pi}{n}}}
\]

Here, the two \( n \) terms in the exponent cancel out, leaving us with:

\[
\frac{1 - e^{i2\pi}}{1 - e^{i\frac{2\pi}{n}}}
\]

Now, from Euler's formula, we know:

\[
e^{i 2\pi} = \cos(2\pi) + i\sin(2\pi)
\]

which simplifies to 1. So, the sum becomes:

\[
\frac{1 - 1}{1 - e^{i\frac{2\pi}{n}}} = 0
\]

Since the numerator is 0, the whole expression equals 0 regardless of the denominator. Therefore, the total sum is 0.

Remember, we initially considered unit vectors. However, this result holds true for vectors of any magnitude. We can set aside this result for unit vectors for now.

Suppose the vectors have a magnitude of $$r$$, geometrically it means all these unit vectors are scaled by a factor of $$r$$. When you look at Euler's expression for these vectors, this is what it looks like:

                          $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r \cdot e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}}$$

Since $$r$$ is constant, we can pull it out of the summation:

                          $$r \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}}$$

We already proved what this summation is: 0

Hence, $$r \cdot 0 = 0 $$.

And that wraps up our proof that the sum of the vectors is zero, using Euler's formula and the properties of geometric series.

The cool thing about this problem is how simple it seems at first, yet the solution has so much depth. What starts off as a basic vector addition puzzle turns into an exciting dive into complex numbers and geometric series.

This really shows how abstract math concepts can give us such clear and elegant solutions to real-world problems.

The examples we saw at the beginning‚Äîelectric fields and forces‚Äîwere just two, but this concept has many other fascinating applications.
