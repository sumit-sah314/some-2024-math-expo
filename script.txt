Title: The Connection of This Classic Physics Problem with Euler’s Formula That 
Left Me Stunned

**INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM**
Imagine there are several forces of equal magnitude acting on an object at the 
same angle. If these angles are evenly spaced around the object in a circle, 
making an angle of $$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$, then something interesting happens. All these forces balance 
each other out perfectly, so the object doesn't move in any direction. In other 
words, it stays in equilibrium.

I know understanding this problem can be tricky at first, so I 
find it helpful to begin with some clear examples to make it easier to grasp.

Imagine a block on a frictionless surface, being pulled by a force in one 
direction. According to Newton's law the block accelerates in that direction. 
But if a force of equal magnitude being applied in the opposite direction, 
making $$\pi$$ (which is 180 degrees) radians, the forces cancel out and the object 
stays still.

Now what happens if we have three forces, each separated by $$\frac{2\pi}{3}$$ (which is 120 
degrees)? We can use the parallelogram law of vector addition which says, “If 
you consider two vectors acting at a point as two adjacent sides of a 
parallelogram, then the resultant of two vectors is given by the diagonal of the 
parallelogram.” In this case, add any two forces together, and then the result 
is equal and opposite to the third force.

Similarly, with four forces making $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$(which is 90 degrees), they will cancel each 
other out because each force has exactly the opposite force to cancel out.

This rule works for any number of forces 5, 6, or 7 as long as there is more 
than one. If there's only one force, it doesn't have another force to balance it 
out, so it doesn't apply.

**COMING TO THE POINT**
Coming to the point, the main goal of this video is to introduce you to a classic physics problem 
that often appears in physics and engineering. But when you dive deeper and start asking questions like why is this true
for all n, the most beautiful theorem in mathematics called the euler's formula comes to handy.

/If there are n number of forces (or vectors in general) of equal magnitude 
acting at a point at evenly spaced angles, making radians around a circle, all 
these forces balance each other out perfectly. In other words, the vector sum of 
all these forces is 0./

**ADDING A PERSONAL ANECTODE**
First time I encountered this problem was while trying to find electric field 
intensity at the center of a uniformly charged ring.

Think of this ring being made up of many infinitesimal charge elements dQ. Each 
element creates a small electric field dE which is directed radially outward 
along the line connecting dQ and center. All these electric fields are of equal 
magnitude because of being at the same distance, evenly spaced around in a 
circle. The vector sum of all these electric fields is 0.

When I asked my teacher why this happens, he simply said, "It's symmetry." Each 
charge element dQ on the ring has an equal dQ located directly opposite, 
canceling each other out. This explanation works well for continuous 
distributions. But what if we have a discrete number of charges around the 
circle? For an even number of charges, each electric field has an opposite field 
to cancel it out. But with an odd number of electric fields, there’s no exact 
opposite field to cancel out.

One way to think about it is by shifting each of these vectors without changing 
their angle, connecting the tail of one to the head of another. They form a 
closed polygon, making the resultant zero. This visualization works well for 
special cases, but what about a more general and theoretical proof without any 
geometry? As someone who loves math, I didn’t want to rely on intuition alone. 
For mathematicians, an idea remains a conjecture unless it’s proven for all n.

It wasn't until later, when I stumbled upon Euler's formula, that things started 
to click. Suddenly, this abstract math concept started making sense to me. 
You’ll rarely find the proof in textbooks or online. It might seem surprising 
that an abstract concept like Euler’s Formula can help prove this practical 
problem in physics. Trust me, this video is going to be interesting because 
you’ll see one of the most beautiful proofs in physics.

**STARTING PROOF**
Let’s first consider these vectors acting at the origin of an x-y plane. Our 
motive is to find the sum of all these vectors. When summing multiple coplanar 
vectors, it’s always beneficial to resolve them into x and y components. What 
does resolving mean? It means expressing any vector as the sum of two 
perpendicular components: one along the x-axis and one along the y-axis. It’s 
like projecting the vectors into the x and y axis. The x-component of the vector 
is ∣v∣ times the cosine of the angle it makes with the x-axis, and the 
y-component is ∣v∣ times the sine of the angle. We do this for each of these 
vectors. It’s really helpful because by decomposing all vectors this way, we 
simplify the math because we can independently add the x-components and 
y-components.

Let's picture this to better understand how decomposition works. Consider 2 
vectors at origin. We know from the parallelogram law of vector addition, the 
resultant is given by the diagonal. You can derive from laws of trigonometry and 
geometry that the length of this diagonal comes out to be this. And angle/ 
direction it makes with x-axis comes out to be this.

For those who don't know what Euler’s formula is, I would recommend watching my 
previous video in this playlist. For now, I am going to give a brief intro to 
what it is. You can picture a point in a unit circle in a complex plane, and 
represent it as a vector making angle with the x-axis. This vector can be 
expressed in the exponential form as, which equals.

Now, let's imagine there are vectors around this circle. We can represent each 
of these vectors in exponential form and sum them all to find the result. So, to 
represent it in exponential form we need to know what angles each of these 
vectors make with the x-axis. Let's number these vectors from to. The th vector 
makes angle, the st makes, the nd makes, and so on. The, and so on. The th 
vector makes an angle. 

So, the th vector is. Summing both sides, we get:

Summing those trigonometric functions can be tedious. So, we express them in 
exponential form using Euler’s formula. It becomes:

If we expand the summation, we get:

This is a geometric series. To sum a geometric series, we use the formula for 
the sum of a geometric series. Notice that is common in all terms. Let's assume 
for simplicity. Our series now simplifies to:

The sum of this geometric series is given by:

Since, replacing x in the formula, we get. We know that:

which equals 1. Therefore, the sum reduces to:

Hence, the total sum is 0. See how easy that was.

Now let's talk about why this idea matters in the real world. Fans and Turbines: 
The blades of fans and turbines are often placed 120 degrees apart. This design 
ensures that the forces on the central axis are balanced, resulting in smooth 
and efficient rotation.

Electric Motors: In three-phase electric motors, the currents are phase-shifted 
by 120 degrees to ensure the motor runs smoothly and efficiently by balancing 
the forces within the motor.

Triangular Trusses in Bridges: The forces in a triangular truss bridge are 
evenly distributed and balanced, which provides stability and strength to the 
structure. This design helps in constructing stable and strong bridges that can 
bear heavy loads without bending or collapsing.
