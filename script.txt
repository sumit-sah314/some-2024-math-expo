Title: This Classic Physics Problem's Beautiful Connection to Euler‚Äôs Formula Totally Blew Me Away

**INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM**

Hey there!Welcome to Math Simplified!

Let's dive into this classic problem which you might have encountered in your physics or math class, especially while studying vectors. Imagine ùëõ vectors of the same length, all pointing out from a central point and evenly spaced around a circle, each making an angle of $$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$ radians. What is the resultant or sum of all these vectors? You might already know that, because of their symmetrical arrangement, these vectors cancel each other out perfectly, so their sum is zero. But just saying "symmetry" doesn't really explain why the sum is zero.

One way to understand this is by imagining shifting each vector without changing their angle, connecting the tail of one to the head of another. They form a closed polygon, which is why the resultant is zero. It's a neat way to visualize the concept. But the point of this video isn't just to give you an intuitive feel for the problem. If you dive deeper and start asking why this works for any number of vectors, you'll find that Euler's formula, one of the most beautiful theorems in mathematics, provides an elegant proof that you might not see in your textbooks. It might seem surprising that an abstract concept like Euler‚Äôs Formula can prove something so practical in physics, but trust me, this video will be exciting because we're going to see one of the most beautiful connections between math and physics.

To make this concept more concrete, let's look at a specific example. I know the mathematical definition might seem a bit abstract, so I'll start with how I first encountered this problem in my physics class.

Picture a ring with a uniform positive charge. What‚Äôs the electric field intensity at its center?

Think of this ring as being made up of many infinitesimal charge elements dQ. Each element creates a small electric field dE, which is directed radially outward along the line connecting dQ and the center of the ring. According to Coulomb's law, the magnitude of this electric field is given by:
$$|dE| = \frac{k_e \cdot |dQ|}{r^2}$$

where $$k_e$$ is Coulomb's constant, $$|dQ|$$ is the magnitude of the charge element, and $$r$$  is the distance from the charge to the point where the field is being calculated‚Äîin this case, the center of the ring.

The magnitude of the electric field depends on the amount of charge $$dQ$$ and the distance $$r$$ from the charge. Since we are considering a uniformly charged ring, each element $$dQ$$ has the same charge because the charge is evenly distributed along the entire ring. Additionally, because all these elements are equidistant from the center, being part of a circle, the electric fields they produce are of equal magnitude.

The vector sum of all these electric fields is zero.

When I asked my teacher why this happens, he simply said, "It's symmetry." Each charge element $$dQ$$ on the ring has an equal $$dQ$$ located directly opposite, canceling each other out. This explanation works well for continuous distributions. But what if we have a discrete number of charges around the circle? For an even number of charges, each electric field has an opposite field to cancel it out. But with an odd number of electric fields, there's no exact opposite field to cancel out. So, does this balancing act still work for any number of vectors?

If you're still not quite getting the gist of the problem, no worries, let me give you another example:

Imagine a block on a frictionless surface being pulled in one direction. According to Newton's laws, the block accelerates in that direction. But if you apply an equal force in the opposite direction, the forces cancel out and the block stays still. Notice our formula holds true‚Äîtwo forces making an angle of $$\frac{2\pi}{2}$$, which is $$\pi$$ radians.

Now, let‚Äôs take it a step further. What if we have three forces, each separated by $$\frac{2\pi}{3}$$ radians? Adding these vectors can be tricky, but we use the parallelogram law of vector addition: If you consider two vectors at a point as adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the resultant is given by the diagonal. You see, the result is equal and opposite to the third force.

Similarly, with four forces making an angle of $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$, they cancel each other out because each force has an opposite to cancel it.

This rule works for any number of forces‚Äî5, 6, or 7‚Äîas long as there's more than one. If there's only one force, there's nothing to balance it out. So it does not apply.

Here's the revised version of our problem statement: If there are ùëõ equal vectors acting at a point and making an angle of 
$$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$, evenly spaced around a circle, such that $$n>1$$, then they should balance out to $$0$$.

So, how do we prove this works for any number of vectors ùëõ?

**STARTING PROOF**

Let‚Äôs start by considering these vectors at the origin of an x-y plane. To keep things simple, we'll assume that each vector has a magnitude of 1.

Let's assign numbers to these vectors from 0 to $$n-1$$. We'll assume, ùëò represents the index of each vector, ranging from 0 to n-1. For each vector ùëò, we can describe its components using unit vectors along the x-axis and y-axis.Here, the x-component represents the projection of the vector along the x-axis, scaled by the cosine of the angle it makes with the x-axis $$\theta_k$$. 
             
                $$\text{x-component} = \cos\left(\theta_k\right) \hat{i}$$

Similarly, the y-component represents the projection along the y-axis, scaled by the sine of the angle.

             $$\text{y-component} = \sin\left(\theta_k\right) \hat{j}$$

Decomposing a vector into these components is useful because it lets us sum the vectors by adding their x-components and y-components separately, simplifying the calculation of the resultant vector.

Here, the angle $$\theta_k$$ can be expressed as a function of the vector index $$k$$, for each vector. Since each vector is evenly spaced around a circle, the angle between consecutive vectors is $$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$:

The 0th vector aligns with the x-axis, making an angle of $$0$$ radians.
The 1st vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.
The 2nd vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2\cdot2\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.
The 3rd vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2\cdot3\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.

Following this pattern, the $$k_th$$ vector makes an angle of $$\frac{2k\pi}{n}$$ radians with the x-axis.

Substituting this expression for $$\theta_k$$ into our vector expression, we get:

$$\vec{\text{v}}_k = \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{i} + \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{j}$$

The k-th vector, represented by $$v_k$$ can thus be written as the sum of these components:

              $$\vec{\text{v}}_k = \cos\left(\theta_k\right) \hat{i} + \sin\left(\theta_k\right) \hat{j}$$

Now, to find the total vector sum, we add up all the vectors from $$k = 0$$ to $$n - 1$$. The total vector sum is:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \vec{\text{v}}_k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(\cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{i} + \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{j}\right)$$

Breaking this down into x and y components, we have:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{i} + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \hat{j}$$

Thus, the sum of all the vectors is the sum of the x-components plus the sum of the y-components. This decomposition simplifies the process of finding the resultant vector.

To prove that the vector sum is zero, we need to show that both the sum of the x and y components sum to zero simultaneously. That is, we need to prove:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) = 0$$

This is a sub-problem within our original question, and directly proving these sums are zero using trigonometric identities can be complex and tedious. Here, Euler's formula provides an elegant solution.

If you have clicked this video, you must have some idea of Euler's Formula. I'm not going into the details of Euler's formula, as I've explained it in my previous videos in this playlist. For now, I'll give a brief introduction. If you imagine a point in a complex plane unit distance from the origin making an angle \(\theta\) with the x-axis, it's a complex number with real part \(\cos(\theta)\) and imaginary part \(\sin(\theta)\). According to Euler's formula, it can also be represented in exponential form:

$$e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$$

In this context, we use Euler's formula to represent vectors in the complex plane, where the real part corresponds to the x-component and the imaginary part corresponds to the y-component. According to Euler's formula, these vectors can be represented in exponential form:

$$e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)$$

Thus, the sum of all vectors is:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)$$

If we can prove that the sum of these exponents is zero, i.e.,

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = 0$$

then both its real and imaginary parts must also be zero. This would imply:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) = 0$$

Thus, the x and y components of the vectors sum to zero, resulting in a zero resultant vector.

Without any further delay, let's move on to our final proof. So our vector sum of \(v_k\) can be expressed as this exponential sum.
            
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}}

If we expand the summation, we get:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = 1 + e^{i \frac{2\pi}{n}} + e^{i \frac{4\pi}{n}} + \ldots + e^{i \frac{2(n-1)\pi}{n}}.$$

We‚Äôre familiar with this series, aren't we? It's a geometric series. To sum a geometric series, we use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Notice that \( e^{i \frac{2\pi}{n}} \) is common in all terms. Let's assume \( e^{i \frac{2\pi}{n}} = x \) for simplicity. Our series now simplifies to:

$$ 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \ldots + x^{n-1}. $$

The sum of this geometric series is given by:

$$ \frac{1-x^n}{1-x}. $$

Since \( x = e^{i \frac{2\pi}{n}} \), replacing \( x \) in the formula, we get \( e^{i 2\pi} \). From euler's formula:

$$ e^{i 2\pi} = \cos(2\pi) + i\sin(2\pi), $$

which equals 1. Therefore, the sum reduces to:

$$ \frac{1 - 1^n}{1 - e^{\frac{2\pi}{n}} = 0. $$

Hence, the total sum is 0.

We can still prove this zero for vectors of any magnitude. Suppose the vectors have a magnitude of \( r \), geometrically it means all these unit vectors are scaled by a factor of \( r \). When you look at Euler's expansion, this is what it looks like:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r \cdot e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}}$$

Since \( r \) is constant it can be pulled out of the summation:

$$r \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}}$$

We already proved what this summation is: 0

Hence, \( r \cdot 0 = 0 \).

This concludes our proof that the sum of the vectors is zero, using Euler's formula and the properties of geometric series.

The beauty of this problem lies in its simplicity and the surprising depth of its solution. What initially appears as a basic vector addition problem transforms into a fascinating exploration of complex numbers and geometric series.
